## Intro

AV Running Stats was created to track and visualise my own running.

I was unsatisfied with the limited data presentation of popular run tracking platforms like Strava and Garmin, so I decided to build my own.

This version of the project focuses entirely on providing a clean front-end and a user-friendly interface for displaying runs.

Please visit the site yourself! : https://alexvesely.github.io/AV-Running-Stats/

## Features

General

- Clean website interface with complex CSS styling.
- Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Run Log
- Displays all runs from a static dataset.
- Ability for runs to be sorted by date, distance, time or pace (ascending or descending).

Visualise Runs
- Running trends can be viewed over a specific time period through a Chart.js bar and line chart.
- Line charts can compare runs to a target goal within the selected time period.
- Data can be filtered and grouped by days, weeks or months.
- Compare total distances or number of runs between a specific time period.

Pace Calculator
- Calculate distance, time, or pace by entering any two of the three.

## Experience and Lessons Learnt

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Use HTML, CSS and JS in a project.
- Design and iterate based on user feedback.
- Use an existing library and interpret documentation effectively (e.g. for Chart.js).
- Build and maintain a project as a personal passion rather than assigned work.
- Deploy and manage a site through GitHub Pages.

## What's Next

I would like to take this project further by:
- Adding a backend, to store and manage user-submitted runs.
- Host the site on its own dedicated domain.
- Introduce user accounts, so each user can log and view their own runs.
- Connect to the Strava API, allowing automatic import of anyones existing running data.
