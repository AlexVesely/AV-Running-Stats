# RunningTracker
A web application to help me track my running

TO DO:

<!-- Date of the run -->
    <!-- WHAT TO ADD: So on this page you can log a run, then I want to be able to scroll down and see all the runs. -->
      <!-- Display the pace next to each run also -->
     <!-- You can sort by newest, oldest, longest, shortest, time longest, time shortest, Pace shortest, Pace Quickest -->
      <!-- Ability to delete a run on the list -->

      <!-- Add these features then make it look nice -->

      <!-- Navigation bar takes you to home, this run logger page, the visualisation page, the pace calculator page, home -->
